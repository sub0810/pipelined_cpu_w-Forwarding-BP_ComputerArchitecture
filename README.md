# Pipelined CPU (with Forwarding and Branch Prediction) Implementation in C++ and Verilog

This project implements a CPU architecture in both C++ and Verilog.  
It supports loading and executing test programs in hexadecimal format.

---

## C++ Version

### Build
```bash
make
./cpu testcaseN.hex
```
testcaseN.hex: Input file containing the test program in hex format.


## Verilog Version (Vivado)
Use the .mem file generated by the C++ executable when running a test case.

Load the .mem file into your Verilog testbench or memory initialization setup in Vivado.

Simulate the design using Vivadoâ€™s simulation tools.

## Note
You can also use Mars4_5.jar(use asm file) to compare the result
